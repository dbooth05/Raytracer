# Raytracer

Welcome to this Ray Tracer Project. This project was inspired by a previous class project (https://github.com/dbooth05/CS_3360). This project is based on Peter Shirley's _Raytracing In One Weekend_ series (https://raytracing.github.io/) and on Yan Chernikov's publicly available Ray Tracer project/youtube series (https://github.com/TheCherno/RayTracing). 

In my previous Ray Tracer project, I only focussed on what was required:
- Shapes: spheres, quads, triangles
- Simple materials: glass, metals, and matte textures
- Image mapping
- Configurable camera
- Acceleration Structure (BVH)

There were many more requirements, but those some of the main requirements. This project became difficult to work with due to its slow nature. CPU Parallelization was included to accelerate render times, but high quality renders would still take a long time (>6 hours). The project was also missing a lot of additional features either more acceleration, high dynamic range (hdr), and a GUI application. These elements are key reasons for this new Ray Tracing project.

Note: This project was developed in a Linux environment and is not completely setup to run in Windows.
